\chapter{On Invariant Subspaces of Essentially Self--Adjoint Operators}

\def\baselinestretch{1.66}

%%% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

An application of the main result of the previous chapter to
the algebra generated by an essentially self--adjoint operator
$A$ yields the existence of nonzero vectors $x,y\in\h$ such
that $\tau(p)=\seq{p(A)x,y}$ is a positive functional on the
space of all polynomials on the essential spectrum of $A$. This
result immediately implies the existence of real invariant
subspaces for essentially self--adjoint operators acting on a
complex Hilbert space. Elementary convex analysis techniques,
applied to the space of certain vector states, yield the
existence of invariant subspaces for essentially self--adjoint
operators acting on an infinite--dimensional real Hilbert
space.

\section{Introduction}

The existence of invariant subspaces for compact perturbations
of self--adjoint operators appears to be one of the most
difficult questions in the theory of invariant
subspaces~\cite{Lom92}. The positive results about the
existence of the invariant subspaces for the Schatten--class
perturbations of self--adjoint operators, acting on a complex
Hilbert space, date back to the late 1950's. For the facts
concerning such operators see Chapter~6 in~\cite{RR73}, where a
brief history of the problem, together with the references to
the related topics is given. The proofs of those results are
based on the concept of the separation of spectra. However,
Ljubi\v{c} and Macaev~\cite{LM65} showed that there is no
general spectral theory by constructing an example of an
operator $A$ such that $\sigma(A|\cal{M})=[0,1]$ whenever
$\cal{M}$ is a nonzero invariant subspace for $A$. This
suggests that different techniques might be needed to establish
the existence of invariant subspaces for essentially
self--adjoint operators.

\smallskip

The fact that the right--hand side of the
inequality~(\ref{e:ESSCON}) depends only on the essential norm
of the real part of the operator $A$, suggests that
Proposition~\ref{p:ESS} might have applications to the
invariant subspace problem for compact perturbations of
self--adjoint operators. In this chapter we apply
Proposition~\ref{p:ESS} in order to construct positive
functionals $\tau(p)=\seq{p(A)x,y}$ on the space of all
polynomials restricted to the essential spectrum of $A$.
Finally, in the case when the underlying Hilbert space is real,
the existence of invariant subspaces for $A$ is established
after solving an extreme problem concerning certain convex
subspaces of vector states.

\begin{defn}
Suppose $\h$ is a real or complex Hilbert space. An operator
$A\in\BH$ is called \emph{essentially self--adjoint}, if
$\pi(A)$ is a self--adjoint element in the Calkin algebra
$\BH/\KH$, where $\pi\colon\BH\To\BH/\KH$ is the quotient
mapping.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Clearly, by definition of the Calkin algebra, $A$ is
essentially self--adjoint if and only if $A=S+K$, where
$S\in\BH$ is self--adjoint and $K$ is a compact operator.
Hence, saying that $A$ is essentially self--adjoint, is the
same as saying that $A$ is a compact perturbation of a
self--adjoint operator. Note, however, that this is
{\em{}false} if we replace self--adjoint operators by normal
ones.
\end{rem}

\section{On Real Invariant Subspaces}

Recently V.I.~Lomonosov~\cite{Lom92} proved that every
essentially self--adjoint operator acting on a complex Hilbert
space has a nontrivial closed \emph{real} invariant subspace.
We give an alternative proof, based on Proposition~\ref{p:ESS},
and thus introduce the idea that will be later generalized in
order to yield the existence of proper invariant subspaces for
essentially self--adjoint operators acting on a real Hilbert
space.

Recall that a \emph{real subspace} of a complex Hilbert space
$\h$ is a subset that is closed under addition and
multiplication by the \emph{real} scalars. A real subspace
$\cal{M}\subset\h$ is invariant for an operator $A\in\BH$ if
and only if $\cal{M}$ is invariant under all operators in the
\emph{real} algebra generated by $A$, i.e. the algebra of all
real polynomials in $A$.

\begin{prop}\label{p:RIS}
Suppose $\h$ is an infinite--dimensional complex Hilbert space
and let $\A$ be a convex set of commuting essentially
self--adjoint operators. Then the set of non--cyclic vectors
for $\A$ is dense in $\h$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Suppose not; then there exists a unit vector $f_0$ and a
positive number $r\in(0,1)$ such that all vectors in the set
\[  \s=\set{f\in\h\,\,|\,\,\,\norm{f_0-f}\leq\tfrac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}}, \]
are cyclic for $\A$. In particular, for every vector $g\in\h$
and $\norm{g}\leq1$, there exists an operator $A\in\A$ such
that
\[ \RE\seq{A\left(f_0+\tfrac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}g\right),
          -i\left(f_0-\tfrac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}g\right)} > 0, \]
or equivalently,
\[ \RE\seq{ i A\left(f_0+\tfrac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}g\right),
                     f_0-\tfrac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}g} > 0. \]
Since $A$ is an essentially self--adjoint operator, it follows
that
\[ \essnorm{\IM{A}}=\essnorm{\RE(i{A})}=0, \]
and consequently the convex set
$i\A=\set{i{A}\,\,|\,\,\,A\in\A}$, satisfies the hypothesis of
Proposition~\ref{p:ESS}. Therefore, there exists an element
$A_0\in\A$ ($A_0\neq{z}I$), with an eigenvector $f_1\in\s$.
Since the operators in $\A$ commute, $f_1$ cannot be a cyclic
vector for $\A$, contradicting the assumption that all vectors
in $\s$ are cyclic for $\A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[V.I.\,Lomonosov, 1992]
Every essentially self--adjoint operator on an
infinite--dimensional complex Hilbert space has a nontrivial
closed real invariant subspace.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The commutative algebra $\A_{\Real}$ of all real polynomials in
$A$ consists of essentially self--adjoint operators whenever
$A$ is essentially self--adjoint. By Proposition~\ref{p:RIS}
the set of non--cyclic vectors for $\A_{\Real}$ is dense in
$\h$. Since for every nonzero vector $f\in\h$ the closure of
the orbit $\A_{\Real}f=\set{T{f}\,\,|\,\,\,T\in\A_{\Real}}$ is
a real invariant subspace for $A$, it follows that $A$ has a
nontrivial closed real invariant subspace.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
If $A$ is a self--adjoint operator acting on a complex Hilbert
space $\h$, then for every vector $f\in\h$ and every real
polynomial $p$ we have:
\begin{equation} \label{e:I0}
  \IM\seq{p(A){f},f}=0.
\end{equation}
The condition (\ref{e:I0}) in fact characterizes self--adjoint
operators on a complex Hilbert space~\cite[p.~103]{KR83}.
Roughly speaking, Proposition~\ref{p:RIS} and its corollary
establish a similar fact for essentially self--adjoint
operators acting on a complex Hilbert space.
\end{rem}

\section{The Space of Vector States}

In the previous section we applied our machinery only to the
imaginary part of an essentially self--adjoint operator $A$. An
application to the real part yields the existence of ``vector
states'' on the space of all polynomials restricted to the
essential spectrum of $A$. Before proceeding, we make the
following conventions that hold through the rest of this
chapter:

\bigskip

As usual, let $\h$ be an infinite--dimensional real or complex
Hilbert space. The underlying field of real or complex numbers
(respectively) is denoted by $\Field$. Suppose $A\in\BH$ is a
fixed essentially self--adjoint operator without non--trivial
closed invariant subspaces and let $E$ denote its essential
spectrum. Furthermore, we may assume that $\essnorm{A}\leq1$,
and consequently, $E\subset[-1,1]$. Let $\A\subset\BH$ be an
algebra generated by $A$, i.e. $\A$ is the algebra of all
polynomials $p(A)$ with the coefficients in the underlying
field $\Field$.

\medskip

\noindent The algebra of all polynomials with the coefficients
in $\Field$, equipped with the norm
\[ \norm{p}_\infty=\max_{t\in{E}} \abs{p(t)}, \]
is denoted by $\Poly$.

\smallskip

\begin{defn}
Let $\EssD\subset\h$ be the set of all nonzero vectors $x\in\h$
for which there exists a nonzero vector $y\in\h$ satisfying the
following inequality for every polynomial $p\in\Poly$
\begin{equation} \label{e:PF1}
  \RE\seq{p(A)x,y} \leq \norm{\RE p}_\infty\seq{x,y}.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\medskip

\goodbreak

\begin{lem}\label{l:PF1}
The set $\EssD$ is dense in $\h$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since the operator $A$ has no invariant subspaces the condition
of Proposition~\ref{p:ESS} is never satisfied for the algebra
$\A$. More precisely, for every unit vector $f_0\in\h$ and any
positive number $r\in(0,1)$ there exists a vector $g\perp{}f_0$
such that for every polynomial $p\in\Poly$
\[ \RE\seq{p(A)\left(f_0+\tfrac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}g\right),
                  f_0-\tfrac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}g} \leq
   \essnorm{\RE{}p(A)}(1 - \norm{g}^2). \]
Clearly, for every polynomial $p\in\Poly$ we have
\[ \essnorm{\RE p(A)} = \essnorm{(\RE p)(A)} = \norm{\RE p}_\infty. \]
The vectors
\[ x=f_0+\tfrac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}g
   \quad \text{ and } \quad
   y=f_0-\tfrac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}g \]
satisfy the inequality (\ref{e:PF1}). Letting $r\to0$, and
replacing the vector $x$ by $\lambda{x}$, where $\lambda>0$,
implies the required density of $\EssD$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} \label{l:PF2}
For fixed vectors $x,y\in\h$ define a linear functional
$\tau\colon\Poly\To\Field$
\[ \tau(p) = \seq{p(A)x,y}. \]
Then $\tau$ is a bounded positive functional on the space
$\Poly$ if and only if the following inequality is satisfied
for every polynomial $p\in\Poly$:
\[ \RE\seq{p(A)x,y} \leq \norm{\RE p}_\infty\seq{x,y}. \]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\tau$ is a positive functional on $\Poly$. Then
$\RE \seq{p(A)x,y} = \seq{(\RE p)(A)x,y}$. Since $\norm{\RE
p}_\infty - \RE p$ is a positive polynomial on $E$, we have
\[ \tau(\norm{\RE p}_\infty - \RE p) =
   \seq{(\norm{\RE p}_\infty - \RE p)(A)x, y} \geq 0, \]
or equivalently,
\[ \RE\seq{p(A)x,y} \leq \norm{\RE p}_\infty\seq{x,y}. \]

Conversely, suppose $\tau$ is not a bounded positive functional
on $\Poly$. Then either there exists a real polynomial $p$ such
that $\IM\seq{p(A)x,y}\neq0$, or $\seq{p(A)x,y}<0$ for some
positive polynomial $p\in\Poly$. After replacing $p$ by $\pm i
p$ it is easy to see that $\IM\seq{p(A)x,y}\neq0$ contradicts
(\ref{e:PF1}). Similarly, for a positive polynomial $p$ we have
\[ \norm{\norm{p}_\infty-p}_\infty \leq \norm{p}_\infty. \]
Therefore $\seq{p(A)x,y}<0$ and $\seq{x,y}\geq0$ imply
\[ \seq{ \big(\norm{p}_\infty-p(A)\big)x,y} > \norm{p}_\infty\seq{x,y}
   \geq  \norm{\norm{p}_\infty-p}_\infty\seq{x,y}, \]
contradicting (\ref{e:PF1}). Finally, in the case when
$\seq{x,y}<0$ the inequality (\ref{e:PF1}) fails for the
polynomial $p\equiv-1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
The set of all bounded positive linear functionals on $\Poly$
is denoted by $\cal T$. For each vector $x\in\h$ define the set
\[ \cal{T}_x = \set{y\in\h\,\,|\,\,\,
               \tau(p) = \seq{p(A)x,y} \in \cal{T}}. \]
\end{defn}

\begin{lem} \label{l:PF3}
For every vector $x\in\h$, $\cal{T}_x$ is a closed convex
subset of $\h$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Convexity of the set $\cal T_x$ is obvious. It remains to prove
that the complement of $\cal T_x$ is an open subset of $\h$. If
$y\not\in\cal{T}_x$ then there exists a positive polynomial
$p\in\Poly$ such that $\seq{p(A)x, y} \not\geq 0$. In that case
there exists a weak neighborhood $\cal W$ of $y$ such that
$\seq{p(A)x,z}\not\geq0$ for every $z\in\cal W$. Consequently,
the complement of the set $\cal T_x$ is a (weakly) open subset
of $\h$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
A positive functional $\tau\in\cal{T}$ is called a \emph{state}
if $\norm{\tau}=1$, or equivalently $\tau(1)=1$. The space of
all states on $\Poly$ is denoted by $\cal{T}'$. Similarly, for
every vector $x\in\h$ the set $\cal{T}'_x$ is defined by
\[ \cal{T}'_x = \set{y\in\h\,\,|\,\,\, \tau(p) =
   \seq{p(A)x,y} \in \cal{T}'}. \]
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
From Lemma~\ref{l:PF1} and Lemma~\ref{l:PF2} it follows that
the set $\EssD$ of all vectors $x\in\h$ for which the set
$\cal{T}_x$ contains a nonzero vector is dense in $\h$. If $x$
and $y$ are nonzero vectors and $y\in\cal{T}_x$ then
$\seq{x,y}\geq0$. However, since a positive functional always
attains its norm on the identity function, the equality
$\seq{x,y}=0$ implies that $\tau(p)=\seq{p(A)x,y}=0$ for every
polynomial $p\in\Poly$, contradicting the fact that the
operator $A$ has no invariant subspaces. Therefore, the set
$\cal{T}'_x$ is nonempty for every vector $x$ in a dense set
$\EssD\subset\h$. In fact, for every vector $x\in\EssD$ the set
$\cal{T}'_x$ is the intersection of the cone $\cal{T}_x$ and
the hyperplane $\cal{M}_x=\set{y\in\h\,\,|\,\,\,\seq{y,x}=1}$.
Note also, that for nonzero vectors $x\in\EssD$ and
$y\in\cal{T}_x$, we have: $\seq{x,y}^{-1}y\in\cal{T}'_x$.
\end{rem}

\medskip

By Lemma~\ref{l:PF3} the set $\cal{T}'_x$ is a weakly closed
convex subset of $\h$. We show that the set $\cal{T}'_x$ has no
extreme points.

\smallskip

\begin{lem} \label{l:EXTR}
For every vector $x\in\h$ the set $\cal{T}'_x$ has no extreme
points.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $y_0$ is an extreme point in $\cal{T}'_x$. By
definition of the set $\cal{T}'_x$, the functional
$\tau'(p)=\seq{p(A)x,y_0}$ is a state on $\Poly$. Hence,
\[ \omega(p)=\tau((1-t)p(t))=\seq{p(A)x, (1-A^*)y_0} \]
is a positive functional on $\Poly$. Consequently,
\[ y_1 = \seq{(1-A)x, y_0}^{-1}(1-A^*)y_0 \in \cal{T}'_x. \]
Similarly,
\[ y_2 = \seq{(1+A)x, y_0}^{-1}(1+A^*)y_0 \in \cal{T}'_x. \]
From
\[ y_0 = \frac{\seq{(1-A)x, y_0}}{2} y_1 +
         \frac{\seq{(1+A)x, y_0}}{2} y_2, \]
we conclude that $y_0=y_1=y_2$. Therefore,
$(1-A^*)y_0=\seq{(1-A)x,y}y_0$ implies that $y_0$ is an
eigenvector for $A^*$, contradicting the nonexistence of
invariant subspaces for the operator $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor} \label{c:UNBOUND}
For every vector $x\in\h$ the set $\cal{T}'_x$ is either empty
or unbounded.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
By the Krein--Milman Theorem the set $\cal{T}'_x$ cannot be
weakly compact due to the lack of extreme points.
\end{proof}

\medskip

Although the set $\cal{T}'_x$ is unbounded for every vector
$x\in\EssD$, the following lemma shows that it contains no line
segments of infinite length. In particular, $\cal{T}'_x$ is a
\emph{proper} subset of the hyperplane
\[ \cal{M}_x=\set{y\in\h\,\,|\,\,\,\seq{y,x}=1}. \]

\medskip

\begin{lem} \label{l:FL}
Every line segment in $\cal{T}'_x$ has a finite length.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose the set $\cal{T}'_x$ contains a line segment of
infinite length. Then there exists a vector $y\in\cal{T}'_x$,
and a unit vector $u\perp{x}$ such that $y+\lambda
u\in\cal{T}'_x$ for every $\lambda\geq0$. For every power
$k=0,1,\ldots$, and every vector $z\in\cal{T}'_x$, we have:
$\abs{\seq{A^k x,z}}\leq1$. Applying this inequality to a
vector $y+\lambda u$ and letting $\lambda\to\infty$ implies
that $\seq{A^k x,u}=0$, contradicting the fact that $x$ is a
cyclic vector for $A$.
\end{proof}

\section{Invariant Subspaces on a Real Hilbert Space}

In this section we use vector states in order to establish the
existence of invariant subspaces for essentially self--adjoint
operators acting on an infinite--dimensional real Hilbert
space. The invariant subspace problem for essentially
self--adjoint operator will be translated into an extreme
problem and the solution will be obtained upon differentiating
certain functions at their extreme. Once again we will employ
the differentiability of the Hilbert norm. We start with the
following lemma.

\begin{lem}\label{l:DIFF}
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are any vectors in $\h$ such that
$\RE\seq{x,y}=1$. Fix a nonzero operator $T\in\BH$ and let
$a=(\norm{T}\norm{x}\norm{y})^{-1}$. Then for every vector
$z\in\h$ the function $\psi(\lambda)\colon(-a,a)\To\RPlus$,
defined by
\[ \psi(\lambda) = \norm{
   \big(\RE\seq{(1+\lambda T)y, x}\big)^{-1} (1+\lambda T)y - z}^2 \]
is differentiable on $(-a,a)$. Furthermore, if $\psi'$ denotes
the derivative of $\psi$ then
\[ \psi'(0) = 2\RE\seq{T y, y - z - (\norm{y}^2-\RE\seq{y,z}) x}. \]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since for $\lambda\in(-a,a)$ we have $\RE\seq{(1+\lambda T)y,
x}>0$, it follows that the function $\psi$ is well defined on
$(-a,a)$. In order to compute its derivative $\psi'(0)$ first
apply the polar identity to $\psi$ and then use the product and
chain rules for differentiation. A straightforward calculation
yields the required formula.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
For every vector $x\in\EssD$, define $P_x\colon\h\To\cal{T}'_x$
to be the projection to the set $\cal{T}'_x$, \,\,i.e. for
every $z\in\h$
\[ \norm{P_x z - z} = \inf_{y\in\cal{T}'_x} \norm{y-z}. \]
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Since for $x\in\EssD$ the set $\cal{T}'_x$ is nonempty, closed,
and convex it follows that the projection $P_x$ is well defined
on the whole space $\h$.
\end{rem}

\medskip

\begin{lem}\label{l:REIS}
If $x\in\EssD$ then for every vector $z\in\h$ and every power
$k=0,1,\ldots$, the following condition is satisfied:
\[ \RE\seq{A^k\big((\norm{P_x z}^2 - \RE\seq{P_x z,z})x + (I-P_x)z\big),
   P_x z} = 0.  \]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $T=A^{*k}$, and fix a vector $y\in\cal{T}'_x$. The function
$\Phi(\lambda)\colon(-1,1)\To\h$ is defined by
\[ \Phi(\lambda) = \seq{(1+\lambda T)y, x}^{-1} (1+\lambda T)y. \]
The same argument as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{l:EXTR} shows
that $\Phi$ is well defined and $\Phi(\lambda)\in\cal{T}'_x$
for every $\lambda\in(-1,1)$.

Choose any vector $z\in\h$ and consider the function
$\psi(\lambda)\colon(-1,1)\To\RPlus$, defined by
\[ \psi(\lambda)=\norm{\Phi(\lambda) - z}^2. \]

By Lemma~\ref{l:DIFF} the function $\psi$ is differentiable,
and
\[ \psi'(0) = 2\RE\seq{T y, y - z - (\norm{y}^2-\RE\seq{y,z}) x}. \]

By definition of the projection $P_x$ the function $\psi$
attains its global minimum at the point $\lambda=0$ whenever
$y=P_x z$. Consequently, $\psi'(0)=0$ for $y=P_x z$, which
completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\medskip

A remarkable fact is that Lemma~\ref{l:REIS} holds on a real or
complex infinite--dimensional Hilbert space. It is now easy to
establish the existence of proper invariant subspaces for
essentially self--adjoint operators acting on a real Hilbert
space.

\begin{thm}\label{t:ISR}
Every essentially self--adjoint operator acting on a real
infinite--dimensional Hilbert space $\h$ has a nontrivial
closed invariant subspace.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $A$ is an essentially self--adjoint operator acting on
a real infinite--dimensional Hilbert space $\h$. We may assume
that $\essnorm{A}\leq1$. If the operator $A$ has no nontrivial
invariant subspaces then we can apply Lemma~\ref{l:REIS} and
Lemma~\ref{l:FL}. We will show that this contradicts the
non--existence of invariant subspaces for $A$.

On a real Hilbert space Lemma~\ref{l:REIS} implies that for
every $k=0,1,\ldots$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
   \RE\seq{A^k\big((\norm{P_x z}^2 - \RE\seq{P_x z,z})x + (I-P_x)z\big),
   P_x z} & = \\
      \seq{A^k\big((\norm{P_x z}^2 - \RE\seq{P_x z,z})x + (I-P_x)z\big),
   P_x z} & = \, 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Since $P_x z\neq0$ it follows that
\begin{equation*}
   y_z = \big(\norm{P_x z}^2 - \RE\seq{P_x z,z}\big)x + (I-P_x)z
\end{equation*}
is a non--cyclic vector for $\A$ whenever $x\in\EssD$. The
proof is therefore completed if we show that $y_z\neq0$ for a
suitable choice of the vector $z\in\h$.

Recall that the set $\cal{T}'_x$ lies in the hyperplane
$\cal{M}_x=\set{y\in\h\,\,|\,\,\,\seq{y,x}=1}$. By definition
of the projection $P_x$, the vector $y_z=0$ for $z\in\cal{M}_x$
if and only if $z\in\cal{T}'_x$. Lemma~\ref{l:FL} implies that
$\cal{T}'_x$ is a proper subset of the hyperplane $\cal{M}_x$
and thus completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\smallskip

\begin{rem}
Theorem~\ref{t:ISR} yields the existence of invariant subspaces
for an essentially self--adjoint operator $A$ acting on a
complex Hilbert space, whenever the operator $A$ has a matrix
representation with real coefficients. Although considerable
efforts have been made to reduce the general complex case to
the real one, so far all such attempts have been unsuccessful.
\end{rem}

\emph{We suggest that further research in this direction is
likely going to reveal additional properties of essentially
self--adjoint operators and thus contribute to our
understanding of how such operators act on the underlying
Hilbert space in terms of invariant subspaces.}
